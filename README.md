# 🌐 MkDocs Portfolio Template

This is the source code for my personal portfolio site:  
🔗 **Live Demo:** [mrchike.github.io/portfolio](https://mrchike.github.io/portfolio)

> This project is **open-source**, cloneable, and beginner-friendly. I'm also writing a tutorial to help you build and customize your own MkDocs-powered portfolio.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository serves two main purposes:

1. **My personal portfolio**: Built with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and hosted with GitHub Pages.
2. **A learning resource**: You can use it as a template to build your own portfolio, especially if you're exploring static site generators like MkDocs for developer portfolios or documentation.
